Additional backend code for E-Commerce Pilot written per acceptance criteria in [provided_assets/W12-hw_readme.md](/provided_assets/W12-hw_readme.md).

## Work Done
* Supplemental backend code written for existing e-sommerce application
* When a user enters database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* When a user enters schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* When a user enters the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* When a user opens API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* when a user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
